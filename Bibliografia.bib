  segmentation from CT images is a task that has been worked on for decades. It
  is an important ingredient to several diagnostics or treatment planning
  approaches and relevant to various diseases. As high-quality manual and
  semi-automatic bone segmentation is very time-consuming, a reliable and fully
  automatic approach would be of great interest in many scenarios. In this
  publication, we propose a UNet inspired architecture to address the task
  using Deep Learning. We evaluated the approach on whole-body CT scans of
  patients suffering from multiple myeloma. As the disease decomposes the bone,
  an accurate segmentation is of utmost importance for the evaluation of bone
  density, disease staging and localization of focal lesions. The method was
  evaluated on an in-house data-set of 6000 2D image slices taken from 15
  whole-body CT scans, achieving a dice score of 0.96 and an IOU of 0.94.",
