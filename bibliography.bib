  Objective 
  To evaluate the relationship between the bone mineral density (BMD) of the fetal femur 
  estimated/quantified by means of an artificial intelligence-based algorithm and the birthweight. 
   
  Methods 
  Single center prospective study conducted at a tertiary maternity unit in Italy between April 2022 
  and January 2023 and including a selected cohort of women submitted to prenatal assessment with 
  between 35+0 and 37+0 weeks. Only singleton pregnancies from women of Caucasian ethnicity and 
  booking BMI between 20 and 25 were included. In such cases a standard image of the fetal femur 
  was acquired using one single US machine and offline processed using an artificial intelligence-based 
  algorithm allowing the automated quantification of the pixels contained in the femoral area 
  together with their relative brightness to estimate the BMD of the fetal femur, which was correlated 
  with the birthweight percentile. 
   
  Results 
  Overall, 151 cases meeting the inclusion criteria were included at a median gestation of 36+2 (35+0-
  37+0) weeks, of whom 27 (17.9%) had a postnatal diagnosis of SGA. No correlation was found 
  between estimated BMD and birthweight percentile (Pearson’s correlation 0.064, p=0.433), 
  however a trend towards increasing birthweight with increasing brightness of the fetal femur was 
  noted (Figure 1). Cases with a postnatal diagnosis of SGA showed a non-significantly lower mean 
  BMD compared to AGA fetuses (144.6+22.4 vs 148.7+21.3, p=0.36). 
   
  Conclusions 
  Though no significant correlation was found between bone mineral density and birth weight centile, 
  a trend towards a lower BMD with decreasing birthweight percentile was noted. The relationship 
  between birthweight and estimated BMD warrants further investigation from prospective data.

  Objective 
  To report the development of an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for the prenatal 
  quantification of the fetal bone mineral density (BMD). 
   
  Methods 
  Single center prospective study conducted at a tertiary maternity unit in Italy between April 2022 
  and January 2023 and including a selected cohort of women submitted to prenatal assessment with 
  between 35+0 and 37+0 weeks. Only singleton pregnancies from women of Caucasian ethnicity and 
  booking BMI between 20 and 25 were included. The collected data include standard images of the 
  fetal femur acquired with one single US machine, which were manually processed by a single 
  operator to obtain the segmentation of the fetal femur contour i.e., the spatial location of the femur 
  in the US image. These data represent the gold standard reference and were subsequently used to 
  train a deep neural network to perform the segmentation of the fetal femoral area automatically. 
  Both manual and neural network-derived segmentations are then used to isolate the fetal femur 
  region from the US image, allowing the automated quantification of the pixels contained in the 
  femoral area together with their relative brightness, the latter being hypothesized to be correlated 
  with the BMD of the fetal femur. 
   
  Results 
  Overall, 151 cases meeting the inclusion criteria were considered at a median gestation of 36+2 (35+0-
  37+0) weeks. The gold standard and the artificial intelligence-based segmentations showed a 92% 
  agreement in the quantification and detection of the pixels contained in the femoral area and their 
  relative brightness, evidencing the output of the neural network is reliable to be used for 
  subsequent analyses. We observed the relative brightness being normally distributed, from which 
  reference ranges for the gestation were obtained (table 1). 
   
  Conclusions 
  An algorithm for the automated segmentation of the fetal femoral area and reference ranges of 
  proportionate pixel brightness were developed. This could assist in correlating the brightness of the 
  femoral area with bone mineral density in cases at low- and high- risk for demineralization of the 
  fetal bone.
